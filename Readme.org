This is a utility that grabs latest version of specified Haskell
packages along with their dependencies and produces a haddock doc
index for all of them.

Currently in a form of a slightly convoluted bash script. Do try it
over and see how it goes!

Packages get built by cabal in a local store which can be removed
after docs are finished. That is, build errors or dependency
resolution errors (e.g. mismatching versions) prevent docs from being
generated.
